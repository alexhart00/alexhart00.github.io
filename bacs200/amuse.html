	<h2>Funny Movie: <cite>Top Secret</cite></h2>
	<p>One of my favorite movies is a comedy called <cite>Top Secret</cite> . It is a movie about “An American rock and roll singer becomes involved in a Resistance plot to rescue a scientist imprisoned in East Germany.” It is a very funny and enjoyable movie that not enough people know about.</p>

	<h2>Amusing game: <cite>Smite</cite></h2>
	<p>One of the games that I play is Smite it is a MOBA style third person game, it is free to play and I enjoy it very much, as the action, and strategy focus is what makes the games so much fun.</p>
