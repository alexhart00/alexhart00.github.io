                <h3>So when it comes to the implications of climate change socially, economically, or politically we need to look at two different views of this problem, the rich countries and poor countries.The effects of climate change on rich countries will be much different when compared to poor countries. We will have a list of cons for each, as there aren't any pros to climate change.</h3>

                <h2>Social Implication</h2>
                <h3>Social dynamics will change as a result of climate change as the temperature increase of places of extremely hot temperatures today, will continue to get even hotter, and the cases of deaths by heat stroke will increase especially for some groups such as the elderly, there ability to cope with the weather, will not be able to keep pace with the new temperature spikes. This may result in climate migrations toward cooler climates, especially in poorer countries as they lack the ability to implement a wide spread solution, as those facilities are expensive to maintain, and in general they are going to be affected by climate change much more than most rich countries</h3>

                <h2>Economical Implication</h2>
                <h3>Economic implications is probably the most important aspect of climate change, as the economic impacts of burning fuel for energy has characterized industries since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and it's cheap abundance has allowed for the many rich countries to get extremely rich by burning fossil fuels. Nowadays most western countries burn the majority of the worldâ€™s past greenhouse emissions, and currently sits in a very comfortable spot for a transition, to greener resources as there wealth allows for a smoother transitions toward these new fuels, however many poor have only recently started burning fuel for energy to the degree that allows for strong economic developments, not burning fuel, or having affordable transitions will mean staying poor for many poor countries.</h3>

                <h2>Political Implication</h2>
                <h3>The political implications for many nations will be a trial, for many rich nations the transition to greener fuels will be seen as necessary, and will be accepted by the generally well educated public, however in some poorer nations the political implications will be much harsher as social and economic implications will have a much stronger negative effect, and extreme groups may find it better to cause havoc in order to gain political power, this groups will fight over resources and political institutions, leading to further destabilization of the countries.</h3>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <h3>The conclusion to this blog is the idea that poorer countries need to be taken into greater consideration then rich countries when it comes to the climate crisis as they are the groups of people who will be affected to a much greater degree than any other group. With the current course of social, economic, and political pressures toward climate change, it is likely that most rich countries will be very apathy toward this cause until, the suffering of other poorer countries will be too great to avoid, and then great actions will be taken to curb climate change, however at that point for many, it will be too late.</h3>
