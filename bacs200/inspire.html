        <p>When it comes to fighting for what is right, I know we are all in agreement when it comes to the idea that slavery is an inheritally evil act, and those who fight against bondage will be seen as a hero to most,but heroes to all who have been in bondage,that is why Toussiant Louverture is my hero.</p>
        <p>Loverture is quite the remarkable person, in history his accomplishments are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He fought as a general during the hatitan revolution, to liberate his people</li>
            <li>He was borned into bondage as a son of an eductated slave, and would later become literate</li>
            <li>He was great at navigating the intricate power struggles between the many political factions of his time.</li>
            <li>He was arrested and imprisoned in 1802, but never lost hope for his people, or his fight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Haiti legacy of being a former enslaved colony that inhabitants rose up, and was able to win independence and institute freedom for all people living in Haiti is a legacy that is still very strong today, as many people look toward haiti as the place where the enslaved rose up against their oppressors and won, serving as a example to all oppressed people.</p>
